Week 3 project of tech educators


Hello hello dear tutor

I found this one challengeing though I definitley have learnt more than i thought I would have by now. 

I had an issue that joe helped me with when i thought i was stuck on appendChild but it was actually a problem further up my code where i was pushing ALL the API data to the getShopUpgrades when I could just make the JSON data = the getShopUpgrades.

My other issue that I spent untill sunday evening trying to fix was a random css problem where I could get my reset button to stay within its container background when the page was made really small. I'm still not sure how to fix this, please can you advise? 

Annoyingly I didn't have time to make the @media changes, sorry about that I promise i'll do it on the next one! 

Help from stackoverflow, teamtreehouse, medium, W3s, scaler etc to name a few.
